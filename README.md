# IW8 MW2019 GSC Testing Hub

Welcome! theses resources are for **testing IW8 MW2019 GSC scripts**. Everything here is experimental and for learning/testing purposes only.  

## ⚡ Tools & Credits

- **GSC Tool** – Huge thanks to [Xensik](https://github.com/xensik/gsc-tool) for creating the foundational GSC Tool.  
- **GSC Compiler** – I made a compiler for GSC scripts using the GSC Tool: [compile_all.bat](https://github.com/AceAdxm/GSC-IW8-SCRIPTING/blob/main/compile_all.bat).  

## 🛠️ Current Use

- Testing and experimenting with IW8 MW2019 GSC scripts.  
- Script compilation using my custom compiler.  

## 📌 Future Plans

- I may upload **GSC dumps** or **projects** here for testing or sharing.  
- This is **not for production use** — strictly for testing and experimentation.
